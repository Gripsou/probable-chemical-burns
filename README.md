Infineon - EVAL-2HS01G-300W-1
=============================

Brief
-----

This repo aims to replicate schematic and layout for _Infineon_'s
[`EVAL-2HS01G-300W-1`](https://www.infineon.com/evaluation-board/EVAL-2HS01G-300W-1)
evaluation board.

Project is created using **KiCad** EDA.

Since this work aims to replicate a desing from _Infineon_ with clear
intensions to allow anyone to use, modify and customize it without limitations
other than to state the changes one made to the project and without any sort of
waranty provided from me, I have chosen to publish it under the

Details
-------

The evaluation board is a 300W LLC Converter with a 400VDC input and 12V
output, utilizing Infineon's ICE2HS01G half-bridge LLC controller. This
controller is designed for high efficiency applications with synchronous
rectification (SR) control on the secondary side, enabling SR in both CCM and
DCM conditions.
